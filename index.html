        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My Name is 'Sara Husain Shaikh' I am 11 years old and read in class 7th standard. My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work.  Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life. Now, I know it well, that reading books is a very good habit, which makes me perfect. This hobby can be developed by anyone, however, I have found it naturally. Reading books keeps a person happy and busy. It is a good source of pleasure, knowledge, encouragement and information. This makes us a successful person with discipline, just, reliable, punctual and even more important.

No person can remain alone and disturbed by reading books. I believe that this habit is more valuable than gold in the world. It gives us a high level of knowledge, ideal ideas, good thinking, etc. to work in various fields. For those who are fond of reading books, good and full of interest is like a good friend.

One who does not have this habit, no matter how many worldly things and wealth he possesses, is still poor due to lack of true wealth of knowledge. The habit of reading a book or a hobby can be attained by anyone trying even at a young age.<br>
